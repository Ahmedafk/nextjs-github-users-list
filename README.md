## Getting Started

First, at the root of this project, create a `.env.local` file to store your **GITHUB_TOKEN** environment variable. Please see `.env.local.example` to see the expected format of the variable.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

#### Note
Haven't managed to get **Load More** button on the homepage working. `onClick` functionality does not seem to be triggering at all.
